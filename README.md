# Driver_Drowsiness
•	Built Convolutional Neural Network model using novel dataset by extracting images from video frames to detected whether driver is drowsy or not by signaling driver with an alarm 
•	Automated the pre-processing by creating pipelines through indexer, assembler, and one hot encoder
